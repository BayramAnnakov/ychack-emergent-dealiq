# PRESENTER NOTES - 3 MINUTE DEMO

## 🎯 OVERALL STRATEGY
- **Total time**: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- **Slides**: 29 seconds
- **Demo**: 151 seconds
- **Pacing**: Start confident, build energy, peak at mode switch
- **Tone**: Founder (not student), professional, backed by real experience

---

## SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE (2 seconds)

### Visual
```
DealIQ
We give every rep a data scientist

Bayram Annakov
```

### What to Say
**[Click to next slide immediately - no narration]**

### Notes
- This is a transition slide only
- Don't linger - your name is already visible
- Energy should be high from the start
- Make eye contact as you click

### Timing: **2 seconds**

---

## SLIDE 2: THE VP QUOTE (8 seconds)

### Visual
```
"Bayram, we can't compete with Airbnb for
data scientists - they pay 2-3x more"

VP at one of America's largest airlines
```

### What to Say
*"An airline VP told me: 'Bayram, we can't compete with Airbnb for data scientists—they pay 2-3 times more.'"*

### Delivery Notes
- **Pace**: Slower, deliberate (let the quote land)
- **Tone**: Serious, acknowledging real pain
- **Body language**: Stand still during quote
- **Eye contact**: Look at judges during quote delivery
- **Pause**: 1 second after "more" before clicking to next slide
- **Emphasis**: Slight emphasis on "2-3 times"

### Why This Works
- Personal credibility (you talked to a Fortune 100 VP)
- Real market pain (not hypothetical)
- Concrete numbers (2-3x is specific)
- "Bayram" in quote makes it feel authentic

### Timing: **8 seconds**

---

## SLIDE 3: PROBLEM STATEMENT (5 seconds)

### Visual
```
Every team needs data expertise.
Few can afford to hire it.
```

### What to Say
*"Every team needs this expertise. Few can afford to hire it."*

### Delivery Notes
- **Pace**: Medium, matter-of-fact
- **Tone**: Shift from pain (Slide 2) to insight (this slide)
- **Body language**: Slight nod on "Few can afford"
- **Emphasis**: Emphasis on "Few" (scarcity creates value)
- **Transition**: Small pause before next slide

### Why This Works
- "Few" is accurate and defensible (not hyperbole)
- Sets up your solution as the democratic alternative
- Creates market size implication (95% of companies need this)

### Timing: **5 seconds**

---

## SLIDE 4: SOLUTION + GDPVAL (12 seconds)

### Visual
```
DealIQ:
The AI data scientist you can afford

✅ Validated against OpenAI's GDPval benchmark
(Real-world tasks where SOTA models score ~50%)
```

### What to Say
*"DealIQ: The AI data scientist you can afford. Validated against OpenAI's GDPval benchmark—real-world professional tasks where even state-of-the-art models max out around 50%. [small pause] Watch."*

### Delivery Notes
- **Pace**: Start medium, slow down for GDPval line
- **Tone**: Confident, technical, authoritative
- **Body language**:
  - "You can afford" → slight smile, open gesture
  - "State-of-the-art models" → serious face
  - "50%" → let it hang in the air
  - "Watch" → gesture toward screen
- **Emphasis**:
  - "CAN afford" (contrast to Slide 2's "can't")
  - "State-of-the-art"
  - "50%"
- **Pause**: 1 second after "50%" before saying "Watch"

### Why This Works
- Direct callback to Slide 2 ("can't afford" → "can afford")
- SOTA reference shows technical credibility
- 50% benchmark sets low bar (your 99% will look insane)
- "Watch" creates anticipation for demo

### Advanced Move (Optional)
If you want extra impact, say "around **fifty percent**" (spell it out) instead of "50%" - makes the number feel smaller.

### Timing: **12 seconds**

---

## SLIDE 5: DEMO TRANSITION (2 seconds)

### Visual
```
Demo
```

### What to Say

- **Body language**: Step slightly to side, gesture to screen

**Delivery**:

## CLOSING (10 seconds)

### What to Say (No Slide)

- **Body language**: Step away from screen, face judges directly
- **Tone**: Confident, final
- **Pace**: Medium-slow (let each phrase land)
- **Eye contact**: Scan all judges
- **Ending**: Slight smile, hold position for 2 seconds

### Why This Closing Works

## 💬 IF YOU GET FLUSTERED

### Slide Timing Off?
- **Running long**: Cut Slide 4 to just "The AI data scientist you can afford. OpenAI GDPval validated. Watch."
- **Running short**: Add 5s to Demo Part 2 (explain more detail)

### Demo Glitches?
- **Preview fails**: "You'll see this in the Excel download"
- **Streaming lags**: "This usually streams in real-time—let me show a completed task"
- **Mode switch glitches**: "The transition usually animates smoothly, but you get the idea"

### Forgot What to Say?
**Core message for each section**:
1. **Slide 2**: "VP said can't compete"
2. **Slide 3**: "Few can afford"
3. **Slide 4**: "DealIQ validated on hard benchmark"
4. **Demo**: "Show both modes working"
5. **Close**: "Production-ready, benchmark-validated"

---
