# 3-MINUTE DEMO - ONE-PAGE CHEAT SHEET

## SLIDES (35 seconds)

### SLIDE 1 (20s)
**Top**: *"We can't compete with Airbnb—they pay data scientists 2-3x what we can afford." — American Airlines VP*

**Bottom Split**:
```
Sales Teams              Finance Teams
❌ Hours on CRM         ❌ Days per report
❌ Miss opportunities   ❌ Human errors cost $$$
❌ Can't afford talent  ❌ Can't scale expertise
```

**Say**: "I asked an AA VP about their data challenges. His answer? [pause] 'We can't compete with Airbnb—they pay 2-3x more.' Sales teams waste hours. Analysts take days. Can't scale talent. What if AI did both?"

### SLIDE 2 (15s)
**Center**:
```
🤖 DealIQ: AI Sales Analyst
ONE Platform. TWO Superpowers.

⚡ Quick CRM Insights (seconds)    🏆 Professional Reports (validated)
✅ Only team with OpenAI GDPval benchmark
```

**Say**: "DealIQ has two superpowers: instant CRM insights and benchmark-quality Excel reports. Only team with real OpenAI validation. Watch."
