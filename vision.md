DealIQ Vision Document
Every Rep's Personal Data ScientistExecutive SummaryDealIQ transforms every sales rep into a data-driven closer by providing AI-powered CRM intelligence that surfaces hidden insights, predicts deal outcomes, and validates sales hypotheses in seconds instead of weeks. We're building the intelligence layer that sits on top of every CRM, turning data graveyards into revenue accelerators.The ProblemThe Data-Insight Paradox
Sales teams are drowning in data but starving for insights. The modern sales stack generates millions of data points, yet:

73% of deal risks go undetected until it's too late
Sales reps spend 17 hours/week in CRM but extract minimal value
Sales ops teams need 2-3 weeks to answer simple questions
90% of CRM data is never analyzed beyond basic reports
The Hidden Cost

Lost Revenue: $1.6 trillion in deals die annually from preventable issues
Wasted Time: Reps spend 65% of time on non-selling activities
Talent Drain: 57% of reps miss quota, many from lack of guidance, not ability
Decision Lag: By the time insights arrive, the opportunity has passed
Why Now?
