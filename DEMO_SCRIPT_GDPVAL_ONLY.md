✅ **Browser Setup**:
1. Open DealIQ in fullscreen (hide all browser UI)
2. Start on **Benchmark Mode > History Tab**
3. Have 3-4 completed GDPval tasks visible in history
4. Pre-select the task you'll execute (task_0001 - Music Tour P&L recommended)
5. Close all other tabs/applications

✅ **Data Ready**:
- At least 3 completed benchmark tasks in history
- One task showing Excel preview available
- Task to execute selected (should complete in ~30 seconds)

---

## PART 1: HISTORY & CREDIBILITY (40 seconds)

## PART 3: LIVE EXECUTION & STREAMING (40 seconds)

### Screen State
**Task executing**: Real-time streaming progress

### What to Say (35 seconds)
*"[Execution starts] Real-time streaming from our AI agents. [Point to progress phases] Watch the phases: Initialize... Analyzing reference files... Generating Excel structure... Writing formulas... Validating output. [Point to active skills if visible] The xlsx skill is generating actual Excel formulas, not just data. This is a complex financial report—revenue by city, tax withholding by country, expense breakdowns. [Progress hits ~60-70%] Almost there... still streaming... [Completion at ~100%] And done."*

### Actions (with timing)
1. **Execution starts** - streaming begins (2s)
2. **Point to progress phases** (3s)
3. **Call out phases as they update**:

5. **Explain what's happening** - "Complex financial report" (5s)
6. **Wait for completion** (3s)
7. **"And done"** (1s)

### Why This Works
- Shows live execution (not pre-recorded)
- Streaming = technical sophistication
- Calling out phases = transparency
- "Real-time" implies production infrastructure

### Key Visual Moments
- ✅ Progress bar updating
- ✅ Phase indicators changing
- ✅ Skill activation badges (if visible)

1. **First to cut**: Part 5 (Excel file download) - Skip entirely
2. **Second to cut**: Part 1 Excel preview - Just show history, don't open preview
3. **Third to cut**: Part 2 task details - Just say "Complex financial report. Watch."

### Minimum Viable Demo (90 seconds):
1. Show history (10s): "Production-ready tasks. Multiple completed."
2. Click execute (5s): "New task. Complex financial report."
3. Watch execution (40s): "Real-time streaming. Multiple phases."
4. Show validation (30s): "99% quality. SOTA models: 50%. Zero errors."
5. Transition to closing (5s): "This is the quality bar."

---

## 🎯 IF TIME RUNS LONG

### Add This (in order):
1. **Extra detail in Part 2**: Explain specific tax rates by country
2. **Extra detail in Part 3**: Point to specific reference files being parsed
3. **Add Part 5**: Download and show Excel file in native app
4. **Extra context**: "This is task #0001, but we've completed 10+ tasks"

### Maximum Impact Demo (180 seconds):
- Use all 150 seconds
- Include Excel download and native app view
- Scroll through multiple sheets
- Show formula bar with live calculations
- Explain specific formula types

## 🛡️ BACKUP PLANS

### If Execution Fails
*"This usually executes in real-time. Let me show you a completed task instead."*
→ Go to History, open a preview, show the validation report

### If Preview Modal Fails
*"The preview should render here—let me show you the download instead."*
→ Download Excel file, open in native app

### If Streaming is Too Slow
*"This is taking longer than usual—must be the WiFi. But you can see the phases progressing. While we wait, let me point out..."*
→ Fill time explaining what's happening behind the scenes

### If Everything Crashes
*"Tech demos, right? But I can show you the validation reports for the 10+ tasks we've completed. Here's the quality data..."*
→ Have screenshots as backup
